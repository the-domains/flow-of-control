[An initial version ofthe mu-semtechsite is online. It contains a small tutorial with an example about a book catalog. More documentation will follow.][0]

The projects at[the mu-semtech github page][1]are also taking shape. For most core components there are downloadable dockers available. The mu-project repository contains a bare bone mu-semtech project that can be extended to a full fledged mu-semtech application.
